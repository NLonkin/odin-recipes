    <p>To cook all of the ingredients in one pan, a little attention to the ordering of the layers is necessary. It may not look like much as you begin the cooking process, but, after 20 minutes and an occasional stir, a layered lasagna appears almost as if by magic.</p>
<p></p>
<ul>Ingredients
<li>1 28-oz can Tomatoes ; diced</li>
<li>Water</li>
<li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
<li>and more</li>
</ul>
<p></p>
<ol>Steps
    <li>Pour tomatoes with their juices into 1 quart liquid measuring cup. Add water until mixture measures 1 quart.</li>
    <li>Heat oil in large nonstick skillet over medium heat until shimmering. Add onion and teaspoon salt and cook until onion begins to brown, about 5 minutes. Stir in garlic and pepper flakes and cook until fragrant, about 30 seconds. Add ground meat and cook, breaking apart meat, until no longer pink, about 4 minutes. </li>
    <li>Scatter pasta over meat but do not stir. Pour diced tomatoes with juices and tomato sauce over pasta. Cover and bring to a simmer, stirring occasionally, until pasta is tender, about 20 minutes.</li>
